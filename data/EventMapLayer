      <name>Winter Storm : Labrador</name>
      <description>Labrador, April 1, 1914. Seventy-seven sealers froze to death during a violent storm on the ice off the southeast coast of Labrador.  At the height of the storm, from March 31-April 2, the temperature was -23°C with winds from the northwest at 64 km/h.  Captain Wes Keane of the "Newfoundland," his ship being stuck in the ice for three days, suggested to the sealers to walk across the ice to the hunt; and if the weather deteriorated they could take shelter on his father's ship; after a long walk, the men found no seals but came upon the ship "Stephano" commanded by Captain Abram Keane; they were taken aboard and sailed to the site of the hunt but told to walk back to their own ship after the hunt; the "Newfoundland" had no radio aboard; both ships left not knowing that the men were missing lost on the ice.</description>

On July 22 and 24, Battleford and Prince Albert respectively experienced flooding. The floods resulted from heavy precipitation in the mountains, foothills and Great Plains regions, compounded by high antecedent soil moisture conditions.  Crops were destroyed and farm buildings were damaged.  Hundreds of homes were flooded and severe erosion occurred in some communities causing road and bridge damage and several washouts.  The extensive flooding also caused an overflow in several municipal sewer systems leading to sewer collapse. The event resulted in one death. Refer to the Alberta entry for more information on this weather system.</description>

      <description>Hagersville ON, February 12, 1990. A fire was set by arsonists in a pile of 14 million used tires; the fire took 17 days to extinguish; the toxic runoff from the melting tires and the fear of toxins in the oily smoke became a prime focus for media attention. The Environment Canada accident report states that 1700 people were evacuated in a radius of 4 km for 17 days; the fire created 20,000 m³ of solid waste and contaminated an area of 4.5 ha with 12 to 50 m³ of floating liquid residue; 25 people were deprived of drinking water for 3 months.</description>

      <description>Western MB, April 1995.  In April, rapid snowmelt sent very high flows into the Assiniboine River and the Red River below the Shellmouth Dam.  Spring runoff and two heavy snowfalls of 20-30 cm each in late March had contributed to the flooding problem.  Public road networks, urban and rural properties and agricultural lands suffered damage. Damage occurred at over 100 locations on the provincial highway system, at over 5500 sites on municipal roads and to large culverts and bridges.  Seventy communities were inundated in Manitoba, including: Roblin, Russell, Binscarth, Birtle, Glenora, Pilot Mound, Melita, Virden, Elkhorn, Boissevain, Springfield, Brandon and Minnedosa. The hardest hit areas were Brandon and Shellmouth along the Assiniboine River.  Both a small town of 50 people and the Sioux Valley First Nations Reserve were evacuated.

      <name>Flood : Melita MB</name>
      <description>Melita MB, April 1999. Melita, Manitoba was threatened by the largest flood in the area since 1976.  The Souris river outflow rose to 169.8 cubic m/s of water compared to its normal outflow of 4.25 cubic m/s.  The Souris river spread to at least 2 km wide at its peak flooding, and almost topped the makeshift dikes.  The flood washed out roads and damaged bridges in several rural municipalities, and made over 800000 hectares of farmland unseedable this year. Both provincial and federal aid was administered in the form of deadline pushbacks and financial assistance.</description>

The Clearwater river in central BC forced 88 people from their homes in Clearwater and Barriere on Sun June 20.  The Fraser river peaked just below 1997 flood levels of 6.5 m and caused low lying areas to flood until June 25.  All the flooding is blamed on the high snowfall of the previous winter.</description>

      <name>Non-Residential : Calgary AB</name>
      <description>Calgary AB, August 9, 1999.  A series of explosions at Hub Oil, a Calgary oil recycling plant, caused a fire that blazed for 10 hours.  About 2000 residents from the nearby neighbourhood were evacuated until August 10 since the fire released oily toxic smoke into the atmosphere.</description>

      <name>Vehicle : Windsor ON</name>
      <description>Windsor ON, September 3, 1999.  Dense fog and high speed are blamed for a massive car pileup/accident on Hwy. 401 near Windsor. At least 40 vehicles collided, including transport trucks, vans and cars, resulting in seven deaths and 33 injuries.  The intensity of the fire, which caused the road's asphalt to melt, and the fire damage, which destroyed many of the vehicles, made it impossible to fully understand how the collisions occurred.  At least five separate accidents occurred, blocking both sides of the highway.</description>

      <description>Notre-Dame-du-Lac QC, May 14, 2002. A fire destroyed l'Abattoir du Breton, located in a small community in eastern Quebec.  Of the 3200 residents, 1700 were evacuated due to their proximity to the abattoir (a 1.5 kilometre radius). A total of 2600 pigs died in the fire. The abattoir was the main employer in the region and 500 people lost their jobs. Emergency officials were concerned about the health hazards of ammonia, possibly in either the air or in the town's water system. Thirty residents were again evacuated when it was proven that ammonia was leaking from the abattoir.</description>

      <description>Northern AB and Conklin, May 14 - June 7, 2002. The House River Fire was first spotted on May 17, 2002. It burned 248,243 hectares. The fire was approximately 100 km north of Lac La Biche. At its peak, 1,000 firefighters were on the fireline. The task was difficult given the strong and shifting winds and minimal precipitation. The fire perimeter was secured by June 7, 2002. This was Alberta's second largest forest fire since 1961. On May 27 the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo evacuated approximately 1,550 people. There were approximately 1,300 from work camps, and 250 from the community of Conklin. All individuals were allowed to return on June 8, 2002.</description>

      <description>Montreal Lake SK, May 20-22, 2002.  Extreme burning conditions existed throughout Saskatchewan at this time.  Winds gusting at 50 to 60 km/h aided the spread of fires (around 48 in total), mostly in grasses and brush.  This specific fire was first spotted around the Bittern Lake area and was moving north towards the eastern part of the community of Montreal Lake.  Approximately 130 evacuees from this community and the Montreal Lake Cree Nation were moved to Prince Albert.  </description>

The heavy rain and the unusually late spring runoff caused mudslides and forced sewage into river systems, and power lines were damaged in Waterton Lake National Park.  A local state of emergency was declared for the areas of: Pincher Creek, County of Warner, Village of Sterling, Village of Warner, Village of Foremost, and the Town of Coaldale.

      <description>Southeast MB, June 11, 2002. Ten communities declared a state of emergency following severe flooding of homes and roads. About 240 mm of rain fell, causing the worst flooding southeast Manitoba had seen in 45 years. Levels of the Roseau River declined for a few days; however, additional flooding was expected the following week given the record water levels in the American portion of the river and the expected crest in southeast Manitoba. Residents and flood workers built dikes and laid sandbags as a preventative measure in the event of further flooding. Several roads were closed and some of these washed out or were covered with water. Crops were severely damaged because fields were submerged under water, and homes were inundated.</description>

      <name>Flood : White Rock BC</name>
      <description>White Rock BC, June 8, 1999. A sudden, intense storm delivered 200 mm of pea-sized hail, and an extra 70 mm of rain in less than 4 hours, created flash floods and mudslides in White Rock, a suburb of Vancouver BC. At its height, the water was over 1.5 m deep. Both streets and basements were flooded, and sewer and water mains backed up causing a health hazard. Emergency workers evacuated people from their homes and closed schools.</description>

      <description>Pangnirtung NU, June 8-9, 2008. Accelerated snowmelt and heavy rains created a massive flood that prompted the community of Pangnirtung to declare a state of emergency. Floodwaters resulted in the erosion of the permafrost, which supported the bridge abutments on the Duval River. The soil erosion caused sinkholes to form which damaged two bridges. Flooding caused the closure of many roads and disrupted residential water services.</description>

      <name>Flood : Hay River NT</name>
      <description>Hay River NT, May 5-7, 2008. Ice jams in the Hay River forced water to rise over its banks, creating flood conditions for nearby residents. Approximately 600 people from Vale Island, situated at the mouth of Hay River and Great Slave Lake, fled from their homes as a voluntary evacuation order was issued May 5. Many homes and business were flooded and damaged from debris carried by the rising water. At the Katlodeeche First Nation reserve, floodwaters knocked out the old Anglican Church off its foundation as well as flooded the Roman Catholic Church.</description>

      <name>Storms and Severe Thunderstorms : Greater Vancouver and Fraser Valley BC</name>
      <description>Greater Vancouver and Fraser Valley BC, January 6-8, 2009. An upper level low brought warm weather and heavy rainfall to Vancouver and the Fraser Valley region after southern British Columbia received higher than average snowfall in December 2008. There was a period of heavy rain from January 6 to 8 that caused flooding, landslides and mudslides. The towns of Hope and Chilliwack recorded 214 and 164 mm of rain. Chilliwack declared a local state of emergency as the flooding caused extensive damages to homes and roadways.</description>

      <name>Landslide : Khyex River BC</name>
      <description>Khyex River BC, November 28, 2003. The Khyex River Landslide occurred on November 28, between 00:20 and 00:30 PST. This is when Pacific Northern Gas Ltd noticed a pressure loss in the pipeline. Approximately 300 metres of 8-inch pipeline was lost. As a result, most of Prince Rupert residents were without natural gas or heat for 10 days. A few days after the landslide occurred, a temporary 2-inch gas line was installed to restore partial service. The spectacular landslide flowed downstream, crossed the river and flowed upstream for hundreds of metres. This type of landslide took place in very sensitive glaciomarine muds, and is called a retrogressive earthflow. The estimated volume of material displaced by the landslide is up to 4.7 million cubic metres. It is thought that the slope failure was triggered by erosion of the riverbank.</description>

      <description>Kelowna, Kamloops and Cariboo BC, May 1 to August 31, 2009.  Fire season 2009 had 3,200 fires, 213 of which were wildland-urban interface fires. On July 18, fires broke out in the Glenrosa and Rose Valley communities of West Kelowna, combined with the Terrace Mountain fire west of Fintry, which led to multiple evacuation orders and alerts. July also saw an abundance of lightning storms leading to other fires of note throughout the province. Temperatures continued to break record highs and little precipitation was received in most areas. As September began, all personnel continued to work hard to contain fires across the Kamloops and Cariboo regions. The Lava Canyon fire, the largest, was nearly 55,000 hectares and growing.  There were over 100 notable fires during this fire season: at least 27 caused evacuation orders and at least a dozen more caused evacuation alerts.  Approximately 20,000 people were evacuated. One helicopter pilot lost his life in the line of duty.</description>

      <name>Storms and Severe Thunderstorms : Ottawa, Toronto and Windsor ON</name>
      <description>Ottawa, Toronto and Windsor ON, April 25, 2009. A spate of fierce thunderstorms broke out across southwestern, southcentral and eastern Ontario. Winds at Toronto Pearson International Airport gusted to 115 km/h, the strongest wind gusts reported since January 1978. Power lines and trees came down across the province, knocking out power to 100,000 customers (300,000 individuals).  Embedded in the thunderstorm cluster were marble-sized hail near Parry Sound, waterspouts in the Ottawa River, straight-line winds and weak tornados in Windsor and Ottawa. In Windsor, the roof was ripped off a union hall building with chunks of roofing and shards of glass littering the lawn and front steps. At Ottawa's Rockcliffe Flying Club, winds damaged 18 planes. Both tornados were F0 in intensity with winds of up to 110 km/h.</description>

      <name>Tornado : Toronto, Windsor, Vaughan and Newmarket ON</name>
      <description>Toronto, Windsor, Vaughan and Newmarket ON, August 20, 2009.  A super cell storm developed just south of Lake Huron and tracked northeastward for a remarkable 200 kilometres. The heat and humidity in Ontario increased once the clouds disappeared. A squall line developed over Lower Michigan and traveled across the Great Lakes reaching southern Ontario at 15:00 EDT. This system produced powerful winds from Windsor to northeast of Toronto as well as destructive tornadoes in Vaughan and Newmarket. While these tornadoes were wreaking havoc just north of Toronto, another series of super cell thunderstorms spawned tornadoes in parts of Simcoe County, Muskoka and Parry Sound Districts to the east of Georgian Bay and north towards Lake Nipissing. In total, the day’s weather produced 19 confirmed tornadoes, including: four F0, eleven F1, and four F2. This was the greatest number of F2 tornadoes in Ontario in one day since the Barrie/central Ontario tornadoes of May 31, 1985. It was also a new Canadian record for the most confirmed tornadoes in one day. Violent winds snapped trees, lifted roofs, flattened cars, mowed down fences, collapsed farm buildings, and inflicted property losses around $100 million. The first tornado of the day touched down in the town of Durham in Grey County, killing a young boy as he left a nearby conservation area day camp. About 600 homes, mostly in the communities of Maple and Woodbridge were damaged. Fourty were destroyed and declared unsafe. At the peak of the storm, Hydro One reported that 69,000 customers (approximately 207,000 individuals) had lost power.</description>

      <name>Storms and Severe Thunderstorms : Southern Alberta</name>
      <description>Southern Alberta, August 1-3, 2009. A cold front swept through southern Alberta on August 1, bringing with it strong wind gusts of up to 100 km/h. The powerful winds brought down a stage at the Big Valley Jamboree in Camrose killing one individual and injuring 75 others. Calgary received wind gusts of up to 78 km/h. The strong winds killed a small child and injured two others when debris from a construction site struck the individuals. On August 2 and 3, a powerful storm developed increasing the severity of the strong winds with wind gusts of up to 107 km/h, along with large hail and heavy rain. The power winds downed trees and power lines, knocking out power to an unknown number of people. In some parts of Alberta, hail was measured at 10 cm deep, with some hail the size of baseballs. Hail caused extensive damages to homes and vehicles.</description>

      <name>Storms and Severe Thunderstorms : Hamilton and Toronto ON</name>
      <description>Hamilton and Toronto ON, July 26, 2009. A storm cell stalled over the western end of Lake Ontario. Hamilton was hard hit. Waves of thunderstorms pounded the city, leaving citizens with flooded basements and motorists stuck in traffic caused by road closures. The midday downpour turned Red Hill Creek into an angry brown torrent that forced the closure of nearby roads and highways. Water gushed into 7000 basements and power was shut off to thousands of customers. While the Hamilton Airport observed only 28 mm of rain, radar estimates confirmed rainfall amounts in an unofficial gauge totaling 110 mm in two hours - worse than a 100-year storm and one of the most intense short-duration rainfalls on record in Canada. Conditions were made worse because the ground was super-saturated from storms two days earlier. In Toronto, parts of Lakeshore Boulevard near the Exhibition grounds were submerged. To the north, a pair of giant sinkholes swallowed part of Finch Avenue West - big enough to hold a fleet of cars and deep enough to cover a four-storey building.</description>

      <description>Montreal, Alma, La Tuque and Baie-Saint-Paul QC, May 14, 2009. Winds gusting up to 100 km/h wreaked havoc across Quebec on May 14. An 18-wheeler was one of six tractor-trailers pushed over on its side near Beloeil. Strong winds cut electricity to 70,000 people by downing hydro lines.  Winds also inflicted significant property damage: in Ste-Julie, winds uprooted hundreds of trees and tossed a gazebo and trampoline into the air where there were left dangling from power lines; in Alma, fallen trees crossed power lines, igniting a brush fire; in the La Tuque region, winds blew shingles off a hotel roof and dropped a street light on a home; and in Baie-Saint-Paul, winds snapped hydro poles in half and tore away roofs.</description>

A freshet in spring 2009 caused flooding in a number of communities, primarily from the formation of ice jams which raised water levels along the Saint John, Miramichi, and Restigouche rivers from April 5 to May 4.  The flooding caused damages to homes, businesses and infrastructure such as roadways.  Preliminary eligible costs are estimated at $2.0 million, which would result in a federal share of approximately $626,000.</description>

      <description>Val-des-Bois and Gracefield QC, June 23, 2010. At 13:41 EDT, a magnitude 5.0 earthquake occurred near Val-des-Bois. The effects of the earthquake were mostly felt in Ontario and Quebec, although some tremors were felt in the United States as far as Kentucky. The earthquake caused the strongest shaking experienced in Ottawa for over 200 years. The depth of the earthquake was 22 kilometres and it lasted about 20 to 30 seconds. The earthquake caused significant damages to roads in Quebec, including a collapsed bridge on highway 307 near Bowman and the closure of a bridge on highway 105 in Gracefield. There were also two landslides in Quebec caused by the earthquake as well as damages to commercial and residential property. Approximately 300 households near the epicentre lost power for about an hour. A state of emergency was called in Gracefield, but was lifted on June 26.</description>

      <name>Tornado : Déléage and Mont-Laurier QC</name>
      <description>Déléage and Mont-Laurier QC, August 4, 2009. A powerful F2 tornado touched down in Déléage at 14:00 EST and track 40 kilometres through Aumond, to Mont-Laurier in the upper Laurentians. The tornado blew away roofs, knocked down walls, flipped over cars, snapped utility poles and downed power lines leaving 4000 residents (12,000 individuals) without power. In Mont-Laurier, 40 homes were damaged, amoung those 28 were rendered uninhabitable. There were no fatalities, although two people were injured and taken to the hospital. The tornado caused about $6 million in insured losses. The tornado's path through Mont-Laurier was 300 metres wide, but its 40 kilometre track was an unusually long distance for a tornado in Quebec and a strong indication of the storm's severity. Previous to this event, the last time a stronger tornado touched down in the Quebec was on the same day in 1994 when an F3 tornado destroyed more than 400 homes in Aylmer.</description>

      <name>Wildfire : Cranberry Portage MB</name>
      <description>Cranberry Portage MB, June 23 to July 6, 2010. A wildfire 13 kilometres east of Cranberry Portage prompted mandatory and voluntary evacuation orders. Residents from Cranberry Portage were advised to evacuate on June 23 due to smoke from the approaching flames. The Iskwasum and Gyles campgrounds in the Grass River Provincial Park were under a mandatory evacuation order. The road between Cranberry Portage and Sherridon was temporary closed to local traffic due to concerns over visibility. On June 24, approximately 200 people voluntarily evacuated from Cranberry Portage as the fire grew in size. The wildfire reached a maximum size of approximately 55,000 hectares and there were 440 firefighters, 13 helicopters and 13 water bombers combating the flames. On July 6, the travel restrictions near Cranberry Portage were lifted.</description>

      <description>Halifax NS, August 23, 2009.  Hurricane Bill dumped between 60 and 70 mm of rain with overland wind gusts of 87 km/h. A marine buoy off Nova Scotia recorded winds of 130 km/h and another buoy about 200 kilometers southeast of Yarmouth recorded a maximum wave height of 26.4 metres. Bill's steady downpour and fierce winds knocked out power to 40,000 residents. More than a dozen flights from Halifax International Airport were cancelled and ferry services were suspended between Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. In Newfoundland and Labrador there were road washouts and some localized flooding.</description>

      <description>Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, October 25-28, 2009. A storm pushed through New Brunswick during the last week of October. Hydro utilities reported more than 6,000 customers without electricity in New Brunswick and about 2,000 in Nova Scotia before power was restored. Some Moncton residents faced sewer backups after high winds caused leaves to fall, blocking catch basins. Several streets and homes flooded after 116 mm of rain fell in St. Johns. Firefighters responded to more than 30 calls for flooded basements filled with more than a metre of sewer water. October rainfall in Saint John amounted to 245.4 mm, which was just 2 mm less than the record set in 1977.</description>

      <name>Wildfire : British Columbia</name>
      <description>British Columbia, July 28 to September 8, 2010.  Due to little precipitation and lightning strikes, from July 28 to July 31, the number of fires in British Columbia went from 600 to 1,100.  On August 18, strong winds blew through the interior causing substantial growth of the fires. Throughout the wildfire season, approximately 461 homes (1,383 individuals) were ordered to evacuate the region and hundreds of other homes were put on evacuation alert. The hardest hit areas were Chilcotin, Houston, Williams Lake, Burns Lake and Fraser Lake. All evacuation orders and alerts were removed by the first week of September.  Approximately 330,000 hectares burned due to 1,673 fires.  Over 1,400 personnel from out-of-province assisted with fighting the fires.  Two air tanker pilots died in a plane crash while fighting the fires.  Both the city of Vancouver and the Government of Alberta issued air quality warnings due to smoke caused by the fires.</description>

      <description>Northwestern British Columbia, October 29 - November 7, 1978. Northwestern BC was hit by two floods. The first was due to a major storm system which struck October 29 to November 1. The second flood was caused by heavy rainfall and mixture of snow and rain occurring between November 4 and 7. Flooding occurred collectively along the Skeena and Nass rivers, and on the Queen Charlotte Islands. The Terrace-Kitimat region was declared a disaster area as the local economy was severely disrupted by the flooding and loss of communication links. Kitimaat Village and Thornhill were also affected while Lakelse Lake and Old Remo areas were the worst hit by flooding with dozens of homes flooded.  Numerous bridges were damaged and destroyed, roads and highways were washed out in many places, and the railway line between Smithers and Terrace was closed because of the flooding. A CN Rail track was undermined – a train engine fell into the Skeena River, causing the deaths of two people.</description>

Multiple municipalities across the region issued a state of emergency. Severe flooding caused the evacuation of 2000 people in Calgary, 1,300 in Sundre, 3,200 in Drumheller, 200 in High River, 70 in Foothills, 58 in Okotoks and 200 in Red Deer County.  Officials reported that the 200-year flood event resulted in significant damages to approximately 40,000 homes.</description>

      <name>Storms and Severe Thunderstorms : Northern Saskatchewan</name>
      <description>Northern Saskatchewan, June 23-25,2005.  An intense low pressure system caused heavy rainfall from July 23-25, affecting an area of northern Saskatchewan already saturated by snowmelt between Meadow Lake to the south and Stony Rapids to the north, and between the Alberta border to the west and the Manitoba border to the east.  The closure of Highway 905 due to flooding in several locations resulted in the disruption of services to northern communities, including Stony Rapids and Black Lake, until the road was re-opened on July 31.  Preliminary eligible costs were estimated at $3,200,000, which would result in a federal share of approximately $1,100,000.</description>

      <name>Flood : Roseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk MB</name>
      <description>Roseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk MB, March 24 to May 21, 2009. Overland flooding caused by a combination of snowmelt, seasonal precipitation and the spring breakup affected southern Manitoba's watershed areas of the Red, Pembina, Assiniboine, and Souris Rivers. The event caused flooding of houses and evacuations from communities including Roseau River First Nation, Sioux Falls, Peguis First Nation, St. Andrews, St. Clements and Selkirk. The flooding also resulted in damage to public infrastructure such as bridges, roads, and highways. Three principal factors led to the spring flooding: 1) Heavy autumn rains, about 43 per cent more than normal, saturated the ground just before freezing in early December, which left little room for absorbing snow melt in the spring; 2) It was a snowy winter in southern Manitoba with some 25 per cent more snowfall than normal. Heavy snowfalls and copious spring rains swelled the critical headwaters of North Dakota sending excessive waters north into Canada via the Red River and its tributaries; and, 3) An unseasonably cold spring slowed basin snow melting, ice decaying in rivers, and overland flow from ditches and culverts.</description>

      <name>Drought : Saskatchewan and Alberta</name>
      <description>Saskatchewan and Alberta, March 1 to July 1, 2009.  The Canadian Wheat Board projected lower crop prospects by 20 per cent across the Prairies. A dozen counties and municipal districts in Alberta declared a state of drought emergency or disaster. For example, Saskatoon had less than one-quarter of the usual amount of spring precipitation, making the months of March, April and May the driest since record-keeping began in 1892. It wasn't just spring that was dry. The soil moisture recharge period between September 1, 2008 and March 31, 2009 had less than 60 per cent of normal precipitation. To the west, in Alberta, conditions were even drier, as illustrated by precipitation amounts in Edmonton, where the 12- month total rain and snow from July 2008 to June 2009 was only 234 mm, less than half of normal and the driest such period with records dating back to 1880. Making matters worse, eight of the last ten years in Alberta's capital of Edmonton had less rain and snow than the 30-year average total, but no year was as scanty as the most recent. Not surprisingly, the flow of the North Saskatchewan River was at its third lowest level in nearly a century.</description>

      <name>Avalanche : The Battery, St. John's Harbour NL</name>
      <description>The Battery, St. John's Harbour NL, February 16, 1959.  A severe storm hit St. John's with winds of up to 220 km/h and left 55 cm of snow on the ground.  An avalanche struck two houses and swept them down the slope, hitting two other houses.  Over 50 rescue workers and residents worked for 12 hours, digging through the snow and the debris to free trapped residents.  In the Outer Battery, another avalanche (caused by the same storm) buried a house that withheld the weight of the snow.  The strong structure protected the residents; however, they were trapped until dug out by rescue workers.  This was the second avalanche to affect The Battery in 40 years.  Inspection of the slopes has shown that a rockfall risk exists, and that The Battery is frequently affected by rockfalls.  The City of St. John's has recently constructed safety fences to protect against rockfalls and avalanches in the Outer Battery area.</description>

The deep snow blocked roads, closed schools and cut off power.  Army units were dispatched to assist in the snow clearing, while food, fuel and cattle feed were airlifted into the province.  Thousands of cattle, unable to forage for food in the deep snow, perished on the open range.</description>

The Sheffield-Maugerville area (downstream from Fredericton), and Fredericton were some of the communities that were flooded; the pulp and paper industry was affected.  The centre of the Province reported 68 mm of rain.  The 60 cm of snow on the frozen ground increased the volume of water which was running into the river.  Over 2,500 private homes were flooded and 536 families (1,600 persons) were forced to evacuate their homes in the central part of the Province.  Only one death has been attributed to the flooding.  Major losses to crops have resulted from the high water, erosion, and loss of greenhouse plants.</description>

      <name>Flood : Saskatchewan</name>
      <description>Saskatchewan, 1974. In the winter of 1974, near-record snowfall resulted in extensive spring flooding across the province; farms and ranch land were flooded, while roads and bridges were damaged along the Carrot and Red Deer rivers; the communities of Pierceland and Green Lake on the Beaver River were affected; the cities of Moose Jaw, Regina and Lumsden, on the Qu'Appelle River basin, received major flood damage; in Moose Jaw, the Moose Jaw River, Thunder Creek and Spring Creek overflowed their banks and caused the flooding of 60 city blocks (including 480 homes) and the evacuation of 1400 people (April 18 and 19); the Wascana Creek overflowed its banks in Regina.</description>

      <name>Flood : Quebec</name>
      <description>Quebec, March 1, 1976. Province-wide flooding caused by an unusually wet spring combined with heavy runoff from spring snowmelt affected several areas of the province; most notably the Lower St. Lawrence/Gaspésie, Saguenay/Lake St. John, Quebec, Montreal, Trois-Rivières, Eastern Townships, Abitibi/Temiscamingue and Outaouais areas. In total, approximately 104 communities located along and in the vicinity of the Souris and Assiniboine River were flooded. Public, private and municipal land was damaged.</description>

      <name>Flood : Newfoundland</name>
      <description>Newfoundland, January 14-16, 1978. Unseasonable weather conditions caused flooding of  the Grand Codroy River on the west coast of Newfoundland. The Grand Codroy River Bridge (standing since 1926) required major reconstruction because it collapsed under pressure of ice floes in the flooded river. The loss of a link between the north and south sides of the river stranded 1500 residents of Codroy, Melville, Cape Anguille and O'Regans. In addition, 244 m of telephone cable previously attached to the bridge were destroyed, leaving the four communities without phone service. In April 1978, a temporary single-lane bridge constructed 16 km downstream from the original bridge. </description>

      <description>Greater Vancouver BC, October 30-31, 1981.  An estimated 70 mm of rainfall caused road and rail washouts, flooding of buildings and erosion. The accompanying wind caused hydro blackouts throughout Greater Vancouver, the Fraser Valley and along the Sunshine Coast. Blocked culverts and plugged storm drains caused extensive damage to surrounding areas. The following creeks reported the majority of the flooding: Lynn Creek, Seymour Creek and Mosquito Creek. Areas which received the most damage were: District of North Vancouver, City of North Vancouver, Pemberton, Squamish and Howe Sound. First Nation reserves also reported damage. One 17 year old drowned while trying to cross a creek; 4 people went missing and 5 people were killed due to the washing out of a bridge.</description>

      <name>Flood : Aklavik NT</name>
      <description>Aklavik NT, June 1-6, 1982. Late in May, three separate ice jams occurred downstream of Point Seperation causing backwater flow to be diverted down the Peel Channel. As a result, the remote settlement of Aklavik experienced significant flooding. Flood waters damaged numerious homes in Aklavik and left debris scattered along the settlement's airstrip. On June 3, flood water reached a peak level of nearly 11 metres. It is estimated that 95 per cent of the Mackenzie Delta was under water. This event was the most severe flood event to occur in the region since 1961.</description>

      <name>Winter Storm : Labrador City NL</name>
      <description>Labrador City NL, January 19, 1982. Leading up to the January 18th event, temperatures were in the -12 to -35 degrees Celsius range.  On the 18th, temperatures decreased further to the -30 to -40 degrees Celsius range.  Winds from the west were 65 km/hr with wind gusts up to 111 km/hr occurring during the evening hours.  This resulted in wind chills of -53 to -58 degrees Celsius.  Heavy snowfall and high winds reduced visibility to near zero, and were the cause of a power outage at the Harrie Lake Trailer Court.  The outage left residents without heat or hydro, and the extreme cold caused water pipes to freeze and burst within a majority of the residences.  The Mayor declared a local state of emergency, loaders and dump trucks were brought in to create access routes, and 2,000 residents of the trailer park were evacuated to A.P. Lowe School.</description>

      <name>Cold Event : Across Canada</name>
      <description>Across Canada, January 5-28, 1982. Three week cold spell; trucks and trains failed and were abandoned until milder weather came; a damaged steel bridge forced a 200 km detour of the Alaskan highway; more than 25 highways in Ontario were closed in areas due to blowing snow and poor visibility.  In the northern Prairies, temperatures as low as -47°C were recorded on January 17.</description>

      <name>Winter Storm : Off the coast of Newfoundland</name>
      <description>Off the coast of Newfoundland, February 14-15, 1982.  The ocean-drilling rig "Ocean Ranger" overturned and sank during an intense snowstorm with winds in excess of 100 km/h off the east coast of Newfoundland: most lifeboats crashed into the pillars of the rig and sank or were flipped over by the waves.  There were no "survival suits". When the supply ship got to the scene, less than an hour after being dispatched, only one lifeboat was found afloat with living people inside: the lifeboat slowly rolled over, eventually killing all inside: 84 died: the severe storm also caused the "Mechanic Tarasov" to sink with the loss of 33 lives.</description>

      <description>Nova Scotia, September 4, 2010. Hurricane Earl landed 35 kilometres southwest of Liverpool as a Category 1 hurricane with wind speeds of up to 135 km/h. The storm made landfall at 10:30 ADT with some parts of Nova Scotia receiving up to 75 mm of rain. The high winds produced by the storm created peak waves of 23 metres in height and uprooted trees that downed power lines leaving 200,000 Nova Scotia power customers (approximately 600,000 individuals) without power. There were also extensive damages to the Halifax harbour and roads throughout Newfoundland and Nova Scotia from uprooted trees and debris. An individual drowned west of Halifax while trying to rescue a boat that broke free from its mooring. It was reported that the man was wearing a life jacket at the time, but was unable to swim back to shore. Nova Scotia’s Emergency Management Office attributed the man’s death to the storm.</description>

      <description>Prince Edward Island, December 13, 2008. An ice storm on December 13, downed 300 utility poles resulting in one of the worst power outages since the mid-1970 and cost Maritime Electric approximately $1.5 million to repair. Nearly 95 per cent of Islanders were without electricity, as freezing rain and an ice pellet-drizzle mix left thick layers of ice on roof tops, trees and transmission lines. Power poles were pulled down by ice-laden lines and strong winds. Across the province, makeshift shelters were organized in legion halls, fire stations, schools and community centres. Rescue teams and hydro crews arrived from outside the province to assist. The Canadian military also remained on standby at the Canadian Forces Base in Gagetown, NB.</description>

Hurricane Irene, the storm that caused over 40 deaths and billions of dollars in damages in the United States, moved north into Canada affecting parts of Quebec and the Maritime provinces. The 400 kilometre-wide Post-Tropical storm produced heavy rain and strong gusts of wind, which downed trees and power lines. Parts of Quebec received more than 100 mm of rain and wind gusts of up to 113 km/h. On August 28, Hydro-Quebec reported approximately 250,000 customers (750,000 individuals) without power and by August 29, only 80,000 households were without power. The storm was responsible for two deaths in Quebec; one man died while attempting to reach his family in the storm, while another went missing and is presumed dead when his car was washed down river. Approximately 350 residents were evacuated in Quebec. Strong winds produced six-metre waves over western Maritime waters. Some parts of Labrador received up to 40 mm of rain overnight, while Doaktown and Fredricton New Brunswick received 89 mm and 53 mm respectively. Approximately 50,000 households (150,000 individuals) in New Brunswick and 8000 (24,000 individuals) households in Nova Scotia were without power during the height of the storm.</description>

      <name>Flood : Perth-Andover NB</name>
      <description>Perth-Andover NB, March 23-25, 2012. The Village of Perth-Andover declared a state of emergency on March 23. The village of roughly 1,770 residents was forced to evacuate approximately 500 people living along a four-kilometre section the St. John’s River on March 24. Within the nearby Tobique First Nation community, approximately 20 people were evacuated to a school gymnasium and six homes were damaged by floodwaters. Public Safety Canada’s regional office reported that approximately 200 homes and businesses were damaged, including those of the Tobique First Nation. The province’s Emergency Measures Organization indicated that unseasonably hot weather caused rapid snowmelt, resulting in an ice jam that was to blame for the river breaching its banks. Andover Elementary School and Southern Victoria High School were both closed due to damages from the floodwaters. The Red Cross used Perth-Andover Middle School as an emergency evacuation site. Perth-Andover hospital also sustained damages; patients were relocated to the Upper River Valley Hospital in Waterville and Grand Falls General Hospital, while some were discharged home. Service New Brunswick’s temporary location in Perth-Andover offered free well-water bacterial testing for private well owners who were impacted by the flood. Health Canada was responsible for contacting well owners with information on potentially harmful contamination in their water, whereas Environment Canada as well as local authorities were responsible for notifying remaining well owners of the absence of bacteria in their water. New Brunswick’s provincial government offered information on government services for people whose property sustained damage resulting from the flood. The response level remained within provincial capacity.</description>

      <description>Kashechewan and Fort Albany ON, March 24 to April 01, 2012. On Saturday, March 24, 2012, a state of emergency was declared by both Fort Albany First Nations and Kashechewan First Nations.  Due to warmer temperatures, early ice break up on the Albany River caused waterways to jam and the water level to rise in low-lying communities.  Evacuations of both communities commenced with 54 of the most vulnerable residents who were flown to the Town of Kapuskasing on March 24, and continued until a total of 269 people had been evacuated to both the Towns of Kapuskasing and Wawa by March 25.  On March 31, 2012, colder temperatures and observations of ice movement resulted in the Chief and Band Council terminating the declared emergency.  All 269 evacuees were repatriated by April 1, 2012.  Emergency Management Ontario and the federal Ministry of Natural Resources co-ordinated the evacuation with the help of federal, municipal and First Nations officials.  Although emergency management is a provincial/territorial responsibility, Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC) accepts responsibility for supporting emergency management in First Nations communities and manages the consequences arising from the emergency such as disruptions to community-level critical services delivered in the First Nation.</description>

      <name>Earthquake : Japan</name>
      <description>Japan, March 11, 2011. Earthquake – A magnitude 9.0-9.1 earthquake struck off the coast of Honshu, Japan on March 11 at 14:46 local time. The earthquake had a depth of 24 kilometres and struck 129 kilometres outside the city of Sendai, 177 kilometres outside of Fukushima and some 372 kilometres northeast of Tokyo. Tsunami – The earthquake triggered a massive tsunami with waves reaching as high as 40 metres and struck land as far as 10 kilometres inland. Close to 28,000 people were reported dead or missing as a result of the earthquake and tsunami. Japanese authorities estimated the number of people injured as a result of this disaster was over 4000.  Over 220,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed.  Costs of damages resulting from the earthquake and tsunami have been estimated at over $300 billion. Nuclear Emergency – The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was severely damaged by the initial earthquake and subsequent tsunami that followed. A nuclear emergency was declared by Japanese authorities following problems with one of the cooling systems. These problems resulted in three major explosions at the Fukushima nuclear power plant resulting in a level 7 nuclear meltdown. The explosions took place at reactor 1 on March 12, reactor 3 on March 14, and reactor 2 on March 15. On March 14, Japanese Prime Minister Kan announced that the 20 kilometre evacuation zone had been expanded to include a warning for people within 30 kilometres of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The Canadian federal department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) provided potassium Iodide (KI) to staff at the Canadian mission in Tokyo and Health Canada monitored gamma-radiation levels at the Embassy, confirming the absence of significant radiation meaning there was little threat to the health of Embassy staff. The Canadian government’s support to the government of Japan included a disaster victim identification team, chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear technical expertise and equipment, Canadian Armed Forces military assets to facilitate humanitarian relief efforts, relief stocks, and emergency medical and engineering capabilities. At the time of the earthquake, there were an estimated 11,000 Canadian citizens present in Japan. One Canadian citizen was confirmed to have been killed as a result of the earthquake and tsunami. Total cost estimated is over $300 billion.</description>

      <description>Southern Alberta, June 19-28, 2013. A massive storm system crept through Alberta causing significant flooding throughout the province. As of 2013, this event was responsible for the largest evacuation due to a natural disaster in Alberta’s history. Beginning in northern Alberta, Fort McMurray declared a local state of emergency when water from the Hanging Stone River breached its banks on June 8. The storm then moved south on June 19, where it remained for three days over southern Alberta. Heavy rain spanning across a region from Canmore to Calgary produced an average of 75 to 150 mm during this three-day period. Twenty-nine local states of emergency were declared throughout the province. Four deaths were attributed to the floods, which caused significant disruptions across the province to power, telecommunications, clean water supply, and transportation corridors, including a section of the Trans-Canada Highway that closed due to a mudslide caused by the torrential rain. In Calgary the Bow and Elbow Rivers flooded, which forced 75,000 residents to evacuate the city. Over 4000 business were affected and 3000 buildings were flooded, including that Saddledome and the Calgary Zoo. The towns of High River and Canmore were also significantly impacted by the floods. In total, flooding forced the evacuations of approximately 100,000 Albertans. As flood conditions improved, some residents were allowed to gradually return to their communities beginning on June 23, while the remaining residents were allowed to return by June 28. Response to the flood was provided by municipal, provincial, and federal governments and non-governmental organizations. Insurance payments are estimated at $1.2 billion. This disaster is estimated to have reduced Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Southern Alberta by $550 million (2013 dollars).</description>

      <name>Wildfire : British Columbia</name>
      <description>British Columbia, July 1 to September 30, 2014. A significant heat wave across British Columbia in July and August led to record breaking dry conditions and “high” to “extreme” fire danger ratings in most of the province. Almost 360,000 hectares of land was burned –the third highest in the history of the province. Over 4,500 people were forced to evacuate throughout the season with the largest evacuations taking place in West Kelowna where 2,500 people fled and Hudson’s Hope where 1,150 people fled in July due to wildfires. At its peak, over 3000 firefighters and frontline crews worked at combating the fires, and as a result, significant damage to infrastructure and communities was avoided. As of November 2014, the Government of British Columbia estimated it spent approximately $300 million dollars responding to wildfires for the 2014 season.</description>

      <description>Quesnel Lake BC, August 4-12, 2014. The dam for the tailings pond at the Imperial Metals Mount Polley copper and gold mine breached; releasing nearly 10 million cubic metres of water and 4.5 million cubic metres of contaminated slurry into nearby Polley Lake, Hazeltine Creek, Cariboo Creek and Quesnel Lake. On August 6, the Cariboo Regional District declared a local state of emergency in several nearby communities due to concerns over the quality of drinking water, affecting over 300 residents. By August 12, the BC Government lifted the ban on drinking water for many homes with the exception of those within 100 metres of the sediment deposit. A final report commissioned by the BC Government attributed the dam failure to a design flaw, where the foundation was built upon unstable glacial till, exacerbated by the dam being repeatedly raised and expanded.</description>

      <name>Shootings : Ottawa ON</name>
      <description>Ottawa ON, Oct 22, 2014. At approximately 09:52 EDT, an armed gunman (Michael Zehaf-Bibeau) pulled up in his vehicle to the Ottawa National War Memorial where three Canadian Armed Forces members were posted on Ceremonial Guard sentry duty. Zehaf-Bibeau shot at Cpl. Nathan Cirillo striking him twice in the back and fatally wounding him. Zehaf-Bibeau then fired at the other sentries as he fled towards the Parliament buildings; but neither of the other sentries was struck or injured. Pulling up to Parliament Hill, Zehaf-Bibeau ran from his car and carjacked an idling Parliamentary vehicle on the hill. Members of the RCMP began pursuit as he pulled the vehicle up and ran into the front doors of Parliament. Upon entering, Zefaf-Bibeau engaged in a struggle with House of Commons Security Guard Samearn Son, who was shot in the foot in the ensuing struggle. Zehaf-Bibeau fled further into the Parliament buildings and was fatally shot by the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Commons, Kevin Vickers. In the ensuing search for additional shooters, many federal government buildings and offices were placed in lockdown. Public institutions such as the University of Ottawa and nearby schools were also placed in lockdown. There were false reports that a third shooting had taken place at the Rideau Centre Mall, fueled by high cellular phone and social media usage that also strained cell towers and communications infrastructure. Government employees were asked to restrict their Blackberry usage for emergencies only until the crisis was over to reduce burden on the system. The following day, Prime Minister Stephen Harper classified the attack as terrorism.</description>

      <description>L’Isle-Verte QC, January 23 to February 1 , 2014. A fire broke out overnight in the kitchen of the Résidence du Havre nursing home that housed 52 seniors with limited mobility. A combination of a lack of installed sprinklers and the wooden construction of the building contributed to the intensity of the fire. Twenty-eight bodies were recovered during the initial search and another four were classified as missing and presumed dead. There were 15 injuries mostly caused by smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning. In addition, two firefighters were treated for minor injuries. The official Coroner’s report issued February 2015 cited a lack of adequate evacuation and emergency plans, a lack of trained personnel on duty at the facility, and a delay in the firefighter response and backup as factors that contributed to the severity of the disaster. The fire was classified as an accident and no criminal investigation was commenced.</description>

      <name>Winter Storm : Southern Ontario</name>
      <description>Southern Ontario, ON, December 21, 2013 to January 1, 2014. A severe storm brought freezing rain and damaging ice accumulation across a large area of southern Ontario. According to Environment Canada, the epicentre of the freezing rain was in southern Ontario along the north shore of Lake Ontario, including the Greater Toronto Area, where ice accumulation reached up to 30 mm. The impact of the ice storm on these municipalities and conservation authorities was further exacerbated by freezing temperatures. The ice storm had serious impacts. In its aftermath, as many as 830,000 hydro customers (2,490,000 individuals) across Southern Ontario were without power for several days. Downed trees, broken branches, and downed wires resulting from ice accumulation posed serious public health and safety risks, as well as transportation network problems. Due to widespread power outages and freezing temperatures, municipalities activated emergency plans to open warming centres and canvassed homes of vulnerable residents to ensure their safety. Power was restored to most residences and businesses by January 1, 2014.
Response and recovery activities began at the time of the event. The ice storm significantly impacted some of Canada’s largest and most densely populated urban municipalities. Municipalities, provincial ministries and non-governmental organizations such as the Red Cross all acted to respond to the ice storm. Ontario determined that the impacts of the storm were severe enough to warrant implementation of an Ice Storm Assistance Program to help municipalities and conservation authorities with emergency response and recovery costs. Two deaths were attributed to the storm due to carbon monoxide poisoning from improperly ventilated generators and heaters.

      <name>Flood : Cumberland House SK</name>
      <description>Cumberland House SK, April 29 to July 03, 2013. Higher-than-normal snow fall and lower temperatures delayed the annual spring melt until the end of April. Over 15 communities declared states of emergencies between April and June as flood waters rose throughout the province. Overland flooding occurred between Moose Jaw and Indian Head, including parts of Regina and south past Weyburn to the U.S border. Significant damage occurred on parts of Highways 2 and 3 that were washed out by the flood waters. Flood waters flowing east on the South Saskatchewan River from Alberta following the June 19 flash floods reached a peak flow of 6000 cubic metres per second, the highest ever recorded, flowing into the Lake Diefenbaker Reservoir. Between June 23 and 28 the Saskatchewan Water Security Agency began releasing water from the reservoir at a rate of 2000 cubic metres per second, leading to a two-metre rise in the river downstream. As a result, 2,200 residents of Cumberland House were evacuated to Prince Albert and Saskatoon. On July 3, 2013 the evacuation order was lifted and residents began to return to the community.

      <description>Southern Ontario, August 2-3, 2015. Southern Ontario was struck by three confirmed tornados, two EF2 tornadoes and an EF1 tornado, along with an EF1 downburst and one other unconfirmed tornado sighting. An EF2 tornado touched down in the small town of Teviotdale located 60 kilometres north of Waterloo and another touched down in Lebanon. Wind gusts were reported between 180 to 220 km/h in some areas. The tornado that struck Lebanon caused only minimal damages, however the tornado in Teviotdale left a nine kilometre trail of damage, which downed power lines, destroyed two homes and damaged several other homes and vehicles. The EF1 tornado in Marsville also caused only minimal damages, mostly to trees. In addition, there was a confirmed EF1 downburst in Utica that caused damages to a local Green Tractors John Deere Dealership as well as an unconfirmed tornado in Proton Station that collapsed a tent sending six people to the hospital. Approximately 50,000 hydro customers (150,000 individuals) in southwest Ontario were left without power due to the severe supercell system that caused the tornadoes to form. Residents in several communities throughout southern Ontario experienced strong winds, rain and hail after the tornadoes touched down as a second system moved into the region later in the evening.</description>

      <name>Winter Storm : Maritime Provinces</name>
      <description>Maritime Provinces, February 15-17, 2015. A major storm system formed off the United States east coast and moved towards the north Atlantic. On February 15, the storm system hit Nova Scotia bringing with it snow, ice and rain. In Halifax the weather changed from snow to rain, creating flooding in the streets, which turned into an overnight flash freeze. Greenwood, Nova Scotia received 56 cm of snow, while in Cape Breton Island wind gusts were recorded of up to 176 km/h. The next day in New Brunswick, heavy snow impacted Moncton where it snowed up to 58 cm. The hardest hit area was Prince Edward Island where it snowed over 80 cm in Charlottetown. During the storm, damages were caused by strong winds that downed trees and power lines leaving approximately 4000 customers (12,000 individuals) without power in New Brunswick. Flooding brought on by the rain also caused damages to city streets and created dangerous driving conditions as black ice formed when the temperature dropped. The huge amount of snow that fell on the region buried vehicles, left people stranded in their homes and resulted in the closure of numerous schools and businesses. In New Annan, Prince Edward Island 20 people were left homeless in blizzard conditions as fires irrupted in a motel where 18 people had to be evacuated as well as a home near Winsloe where two people had to be evacuated. In addition, an apartment fire in Fredericton resulted in the evacuation of one individual.</description>

During the wildfire season that spanned from May to September, over 1,800 fires burned over 300,000 hectares of land. Approximately two thirds of the fires were caused by lighting. The season began early with the discovery of the Little Bobtail Lake fire on May 9. Many fires were within a close proximity of urban areas prompting evacuation orders and alerts across the province. A number of communities were affected by evacuation orders and alerts. Evacuation orders were issued for 141 homes in Joe Rich Kelowna, 70 homes in West Kelowna, 150 homes in Port Hardy and 110 homes in Testalinden, including others. In Puntzi Lake, 90 homes were evacuated and 18 structures were destroyed, while in Rock Creek 330 homes were evacuated and 30 homes as well as 15 other structures were destroyed. Across the province, 1,144 homes (approximately 3,432 individuals) were evacuated due to wildfires. BC Hydro was forced to cut power to certain communities as a precaution, like in West Kelowna where power was cut to 100 customers (approximately 300 individuals). Additional personnel and resources were needed to help battle to above average number of fires burning throughout the province including 310 out-of province firefighters as well as firefighters from Australia, South Africa and the United states. In total, 2,500 firefighters and support workers were working across the province during the peak of the wildfire season. One man was fatally injured while felling a danger tree at the Old Sechelt Mine fire.</description>

      <name>Storms and Severe Thunderstorms : Alberta and Saskatchewan</name>
      <description>Alberta and Saskatchewan, July 22, 2015. Severe thunderstorms affected the southern Alberta region before moving into Saskatchewan. A storm system southwest of Calgary produced a small tornado that touched down in the Tsuu T’ina Nation at 12:53 MTZ as well as multiple funnel clouds, which were spotted in the Calgary area. The impact of the tornado was minimal, however the proximity of the tornado to a highly populated area like Calgary created an extremely high level of risk. Southern areas of Calgary including Canyon Meadows and Lake Bonavista were hit with large hail and as the storm moved east, Hussar, Patricia and Strathmore were impacted by strong wind gusts that downed trees over power lines resulting in localized power outages. A severe thunderstorm warning was in effect at the time meaning that wind gusts exceeded 90 km/h and hail was greater than two cm. The storm later reached Saskatchewan where the town of Kerrobert was hit with severe hail, prompting a state of emergency to be declared. Other communities in Saskatchewan such as Anglin Lake, Francis, Sedley and Regina were impacted by strong winds, heavy rain, hail and lighting. Golf-ball sized hail caused the most significant damages during the storm, including damages to roofs, windows and vehicles.</description>

      <name>Epidemic : Alberta and Saskatchewan</name>
      <description>Alberta and Saskatchewan, October 26 to December 21, 2016. In late September, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) discovered a case of bovine tuberculosis (TB) found in a cow from Alberta. The USDA then contacted the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) whom initiated an investigation into the outbreak. The investigation found that one herd of cattle in Alberta was infected with TB. The one infected herd was located on 18 separate properties. Within the infected herd there were six confirmed cases of TB, including the cow that was slaughtered in the United states. The infection resulted in the quarantine of approximately 26,000 cattle from approximately 50 different properties in both Alberta and Saskatchewan. As a precaution, approximately 10,000 cattle were destroyed in order to stop the spread of the infection. The infection significantly impacted farmers in Alberta and Saskatchewan. The federal government of Canada offered to pay up to $16.7 million for ranchers who suffered agricultural loses due to the TB outbreak.</description>

      <description>South Coast and Lower Mainland British Columbia, March 9-10, 2016. A storm system off the coast of British Columbia generated a windstorm that impacted Vancouver Island, the southwest coast and the lower mainland. The storm produced up to 100 mm of rain and wind gusts of over 100 km/h in some parts. Heavy rainfall caused localized flooding in Comox Valley, Port Mellon and Port Alberni as well as caused a mudslide in Cowichan Valley. Strong winds and high tide contributed towards a storm surge that accompanied the storm, causing coastal flooding in Delta, Richmond and White Rock. The strong winds were attributed for causing the most significant damages including fallen trees that downed power lines, resulting in 160,000 BC Hydro customer (approximately 480,000 individuals) being without power. Due to the power outages, 11 schools in Surrey, five in Abbotsford and five in Mission were closed. The powerful winds also damaged roofs, broke windows and even flipped over a Cessna aircraft.

      <name>Leak / Spill Release : Seaforth Channel BC</name>
      <description>Seaforth Channel BC, October 13, 2016. The articulated barge and tug, Nathan E. Stewart, ran aground near Bella Bella in the Seaforth Channel. The tug, which contained 215,000 litres of diesel, began taking on water resulting in the empty barge breaking free from the tug. The tug was partially submerged and two of its fuel tanks were breached causing fuel to leak into the waters off the coast of the Great Bear Rainforest. The barge and tug, which were owned by the U.S. company Kirby Offshore Marine, were travelling south from Alaska. On October 14, two aerial flights confirmed that the sheen had spread throughout the Gale passage. Protection and containment efforts consisted of absorbent booms that were deployed around the damaged tug and booming along the Gale Passage, which included the application of petroleum sorbent. A dive team partially repaired sections of the breached fuel tanks to reduce the leakage while workers attempted to pump out the remaining fuel inside. Clean up and salvage recovery efforts were hindered by bad weather. It was not until November 15 when the tug was finally lifted out of the water and taken to shore on a salvage barge. It is estimated that 108,000 litres of fuel and 2,240 litres of lubricants were spilled. Most impacted by the leak was the Heiltsuk First Nation who closed local clam fisheries due to environmental concerns.</description>

      <name>Wildfire : Fort McMurray AB</name>
      <description>Fort McMurray AB, April 30 to June 1, 2016. In May 2016, wildfires broke out in northern Alberta resulting in the most expensive natural disaster in the history of Canada. The city of Fort McMurray, located in the heart of the Athabasca oil sands, was hit by a massive system of wildfires that swept through the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo. The first wildfire was discovered on April 30, north of Fort McMurray. The Regional Municipality declared a local state of emergency and a mandatory evacuation order for Centennial Park on May 1 as well as another evacuation order for Prairie Creek and Centennial Trailer Park on May 2. The Fort McMurray fire grew rapidly due to hot and dry weather conditions, doubling in size to 2,656 hectares in a manner of hours. On May 3, the wildfire intensified and crossed over Highway 63, cutting off the route to evacuees, prompting the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation to declare a state of local emergency and a mandatory evacuation order for Fort McMurray’s Lower Townsite and downtown area, which included the communities of Gregoire, Beacon Hill, Abasand, Waterways, Draper, Saline Creek, Grayling Terrace, Thickwood, Wood Buffalo and Dickinsfield. Later in the day the entire city of Fort McMurray was under a mandatory evacuation order. During the evacuations two people were killed in a car crash. On May 4, the Alberta government declared a provincial state of emergency. The Fort McMurray fire quickly grew to 85,000 hectares as the wildfire spread further north and east eventually passing through Fort McMurray. Evacuees that fled north of Fort McMurray had to be air lifted to safety. Some evacuees were taken to Lac La Biche, while the majority where sent to Edmonton and Calgary. On May 10, two of the main Fort McMurray fires joined together and formed a massive blaze of 229,000 hectares. On May 16, all workers in work camps and oil sand operations north of Fort McMurray were forced to move south as the wildfire spread further north. Residents of Fort McMurray were allowed to return home on June 1. In total, the Fort McMurray fires burned approximately 579,767 hectares of land causing the evacuation of over 90,000 people and destroyed 2,400 homes and business, including 530 other buildings that were damaged. At its peak, there were over 2000 firefighters working the fires daily, including helicopters and water bombers. In addition, firefighters received help from 200 firefighters from the United States, 60 from Mexico and 298 from South Africa.
